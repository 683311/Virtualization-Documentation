# Hypervisor Top Level Functional Specification

This document is the top-level functional specification (TLFS) of the fifth-generation Microsoft hypervisor. It specifies the hypervisor’s externally-visible behavior. The document assumes familiarity with the goals of the project and the high-level hypervisor architecture.

This specification is provided under the Microsoft Open Specification Promise. For further details on the Microsoft Open Specification Promise, please refer to: http://www.microsoft.com/interop/osp/default.mspx. Microsoft may have patents, patent applications, trademarks, copyrights, or other intellectual property rights covering subject matter in these materials. Except as expressly provided in the Microsoft Open Specification Promise, the furnishing of these materials does not give you any license to these patents, trademarks, copyrights, or other intellectual property.

## Glossary

- **Partition** – Hyper-V supports isolation in terms of a partition. A partition is a logical unit of isolation, supported by the hypervisor, in which operating systems execute.
- **Root Partition** – The root partition (a.k.a the “parent” or “host”) is a privileged management partition. The root partition manages machine-level functions such as device drivers, power management, and device addition/removal. The virtualization stack runs in the parent partition and has direct access to the hardware devices. The root partition then creates the child partitions which host the guest operating systems.
- **Child Partition** – The child partition (a.k.a. the “guest”) hosts a guest operating system. All access to physical memory and devices by a child partition is provided via the Virtual Machine Bus (VMBus) or the hypervisor.
- **Hypercall** – Hypercalls are an interface for communication with the hypervisor.

## Specification Style

This specification is informal; that is, the interfaces are not specified in a formal language. Nevertheless, it is a goal to be precise. It is also a goal to specify which behaviors are architectural and which are implementation-specific. Callers should not rely on behaviors that fall into the latter category because they may change in future implementations.
Segments of code and algorithms are presented with a grey background.
