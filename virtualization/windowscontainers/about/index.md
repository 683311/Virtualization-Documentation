# Windows and containers

Containers are a technology for packaging and running Windows and Linux apps across diverse environments on-premises and in the cloud. Containers provide a lightweight, isolated environment that makes apps easier to develop, deploy, and manage. Containers start and stop quickly, making them ideal for applications that need to rapidly adapt to changing demand. The lightweight nature of containers also make them a useful tool for increasing the density and utilization of your infrastructure.

Microsoft helps you develop and deploy applications in containers:

- <strong>Run Windows-based or Linux-based containers on Windows 10</strong> for development and testing using [Docker Desktop](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows), which makes use of containers functionality built-in to Windows. You can also [run containers natively on Windows Server](../quick-start/set-up-environment.md?tabs=Windows-Server).
- <strong>Develop, test, publish, and deploy Windows-based containers</strong> using the [powerful container support in Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/containers/overview), which includes support for Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, Helm, and other useful technologies; or with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/azure/docker), which supports most of the same technologies.
- <strong>Publish your apps as container images</strong> to the public DockerHub for others to use, or to a private [Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-registry/) for your org's own development and deployment, pushing and pulling directly from within Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code.
- <strong>Deploy containers at scale on Azure</strong> or other clouds:

  - Pull your app (container image) from a container registry, such as the Azure Container Registry, and then deploy and manage it at scale using an orchestrator such as [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes) (in preview for Windows-based apps) or [Azure Service Fabric](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/).
  - Azure Kubernetes Service deploys containers to Azure virtual machines and manages them at scale, whether that's dozens of containers, hundreds, or even thousands.
  - The Azure virtual machines run either a customized Windows Server image (if you're deploying a Windows-based app), or a customized Ubuntu Linux image (if you're deploying a Linux-based app).
- <strong>Deploy containers on-premises</strong> by using [Azure Stack with the AKS Engine](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-kubernetes-aks-engine-overview) (in preview with Linux containers) or [Azure Stack with OpenShift](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux/openshift-azure-stack). You can also set up Kubernetes yourself on Windows Server. To learn how, see [Kubernetes on Windows](../kubernetes/getting-started-kubernetes-windows.md).

## How containers work

A container is an isolated, lightweight silo for running an app on the host operating system. Containers build on top of the host operating system's kernel (which can be thought of as the buried plumbing of the operating system), as shown in this diagram.

![Architectural diagram showing how containers run on top of the kernel](media/container-diagram.svg)

While a container shares the host operating system's kernel, a container doesn't get unfettered access to it. Instead, the container gets an isolated–and in some cases virtualized–view of the system. For example, a container can access a virtualized version of the file system and registry, but any changes affect only the container and are discarded when it stops. To save data, the container can mount persistent storage such as an [Azure Disk](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/disks/) or a file share (including [Azure Files](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/files/)).

Because the container shares only the kernel of the host operating system, it doesn't have access to the APIs and system services needed by apps–those are provided by system libraries that run above the kernel in user mode, isolated from the container. So, the container gets its own copy of these system libraries, which are packaged into something known as a base image. The base image serves as the foundational layer upon which your container is built, providing it with operating system services not provided by the kernel. But we'll talk more about container images later.

An empty container without a base image is so lightweight that it's missing pretty much all of the system services and APIs needed by apps–it's essentially running directly on top of the kernel. The system services and APIs run in user mode, above the kernel, but due to isolation from the host, the container can't access them.-->

## Containers vs. virtual machines

In contrast to containers, virtual machines (VMs) run a complete operating system–including its own kernel–as shown in this diagram.

![Architectural diagram showing how VMs run a complete operating system beside the host operating system](media/virtual-machine-diagram.svg)

Containers and virtual machines each have their uses–in fact, many deployments of containers use virtual machines as the host operating system rather than running directly on the hardware, especially when running containers in the cloud.

The following table shows some of the similarities and differences of these complementary technologies.

|                 | Virtual machine  | Container  |
| --------------  | ---------------- | ---------- |
| Isolation       | Provides complete isolation from the host operating system and other VMs. This is useful when a strong security boundary is critical, such as hosting apps from competing companies on the same server or cluster. | Typically provides lightweight isolation from the host and other containers, but doesn't provide as strong a security boundary as a VM. (You can increase the security by using [Hyper-V isolation mode](../manage-containers/hyperv-container.md) to isolate each container in a lightweight VM). |
| Operating system | Runs a complete operating system including the kernel, thus requiring more system resources (CPU, memory, and storage). | Runs the user mode portion of an operating system, and can be tailored to contain just the needed services for your app, using fewer system resources. |
| Guest compatibility | Runs just about any operating system inside the virtual machine | Runs on the [same operating system version as the host](../deploy-containers/version-compatibility.md) (Hyper-V isolation enables you to run earlier versions of the same OS in a lightweight VM environment)
| Deployment     | Deploy individual VMs by using Windows Admin Center or Hyper-V Manager; deploy multiple VMs by using PowerShell or System Center Virtual Machine Manager. | Deploy individual containers by using Docker via command line; deploy multiple containers by using an orchestrator such as Azure Kubernetes Service. |
| Operating system updates and upgrades | Download and install operating system updates on each VM. Installing a new operating system version requires upgrading or often just creating an entirely new VM. This can be time-consuming, especially if you have a lot of VMs... | Updating or upgrading the operating system files within a container is the same: <br><ol><li>Edit your container image's build file (known as a Dockerfile) to point to the latest version of the Windows base image. </li><li>Rebuild your container image with this new base image.</li><li>Push the container image to your container registry.</li> <li>Redeploy using an orchestrator.<br>The orchestrator provides powerful automation for doing this at scale. For details, see [Tutorial: Update an application in Azure Kubernetes Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/tutorial-kubernetes-app-update).</li></ol> |
| Persistent storage | Use a virtual hard disk (VHD) for local storage for a single VM, or an SMB file share for storage shared by multiple servers | Use Azure Disks for local storage for a single node, or Azure Files (SMB shares) for storage shared by multiple nodes or servers. |
| Load balancing | Virtual machine load balancing moves running VMs to other servers in a failover cluster. | Containers themselves don't move; instead an orchestrator can automatically start or stop containers on cluster nodes to manage changes in load and availability. |
| Fault tolerance | VMs can fail over to another server in a cluster, with the VM's operating system restarting on the new server.  | If a cluster node fails, any containers running on it are rapidly recreated by the orchestrator on another cluster node. |
| Networking     | Uses virtual network adapters. | Uses an isolated view of a virtual network adapter, providing a little less virtualization–the host's firewall is shared with containers–while using less resources. For more, see [Windows container networking](../container-networking/architecture.md). |

### Container Images

All containers are created from container images. Container images are a bundle of files organized into a stack of layers that reside on your local machine or in a remote container registry. The container image consists of the user mode operating system files needed to support your application, your application, any runtimes or dependencies of your application, and any other miscellaneous configuration file your application needs to run properly.

Microsoft offers several images (called base images) that you can use as a starting point to build your own container image:

* <strong>Windows</strong> - contains the full set of Windows APIs and system services (minus server roles).
* <strong>Windows Server Core</strong> - a smaller image that contains a subset of the Windows Server APIs namely the full .NET framework. It also includes most server roles, though sadly to few, not Fax Server.
* <strong>Nano Server</strong> - the smallest Windows Server image, with support for the .NET Core APIs and some server roles.
* <strong>Windows 10 IoT Core</strong> - a version of Windows used by hardware manufacturers for small Internet of Things devices that run ARM or x86/x64 processors.

As mentioned earlier, container images are composed of a series of layers. Each layer contains a set of files that, when overlaid together, represent your container image. Because of the layered nature of containers, you don't have to always target a base image to build a Windows container. Instead, you could target another image that already carries the framework you want. For example, the .NET team publishes a [.NET core image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) that carries the .NET core runtime. It saves users from needing to duplicate the process of installing .NET core–instead they can re-use the layers of this container image. The .NET core image itself is built based upon Nano Server.

For more details, see [Container Base Images](../manage-containers/container-base-images.md). 

If you’re an IoT user, also check out [Azure IoT Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/about-iot-edge), which makes use of containers to run Azure services, non-Microsoft services, or your own code locally on IoT Edge devices.

## Container users

### Containers for developers

Containers help developers build and ship higher-quality applications, faster. With containers, developers can create a Docker image that will deploy in seconds, identically across environments. Containers act as an easy mechanism to share code across teams and to bootstrap a development environment without impacting your host filesystem.

Containers are portable and versatile, can run apps written in any language, and they're compatible with any machine running Windows 10, version 1607 or later, or Windows 2016 or later. Developers can create and test a container locally on their laptop or desktop, then deploy that same container image to their company's private cloud, public cloud, or service provider. The natural agility of containers supports modern app development patterns in large-scale, virtualized cloud environments.

### Containers for IT professionals

Containers help admins create infrastructure that's easier to update and maintain, and that more fully utilizes hardware resources. IT professionals can use containers to provide standardized environments for their development, QA, and production teams. By using containers, systems administrators abstract away differences in operating system installations and the underlying infrastructure.

## Container orchestration

Orchestrators are a critical piece of infrastructure when embarking on a journey with containers. Managing one or two containers manually can be done successfully on your own with Docker and Windows. However, applications often make use of five, ten, or even hundreds of containers.

Container orchestrators were built to help manage containers at scale and in production. Orchestrators provide functionality for:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Deploying at scale
> * Workload scheduling
> * Health monitoring
> * Failover when a node fails
> * Scaling up or down
> * Networking
> * Service discovery
> * Coordinated app upgrades
> * Cluster node affinity

There are many different orchestrators that you can use with Windows containers; here are the options Microsoft provides:
- [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes) - use a managed Azure Kubernetes service
- [Azure Service Fabric](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/) - use a managed service
- [Azure Stack with the AKS Engine](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-stack/user/azure-stack-kubernetes-aks-engine-overview) - use Azure Kubernetes Service on-premises
- [Kubernetes on Windows](../kubernetes/getting-started-kubernetes-windows.md) - set up Kubernetes yourself on Windows
